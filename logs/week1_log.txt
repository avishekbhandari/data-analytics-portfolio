Topics Studied:

- SQL SELECT
SELECT * FROM Customer; -- select all data from the Customer table

SELECT CustomerName, Age, DOB FROM Customer; -- select specific field from the Customer table;

SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customer; -- select all different country names but if we omit the DISTINCT keyword, the country name will appear as many times as it is in the table.


- WHERE
WHERE is the clause that filters records. Extract only those records that fulfill the given condition.

SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE Country = "Mexico"; Extract all record from the Customer table which fulfilled the given condition.


- NULL VALUE
A field with a NULL value is a field with no value. Keywords used IS NULL and IS NOT NULL.

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE Address IS NULL; -- Extract all records with a null value in the Address field.

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE Address IS NOT NULL; -- Extract all records from the table that have a value in the Address field.


- GROUP BY
GROUP BY clause groups the rows that have the same value into summary rows. It is often used with aggregate functions to group the result set by one or more fields.
Any field that appears in the SELECT clause and is not aggregated must also appear in the GROUP BY clause.

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customer GROUP BY Country ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC; -- this query has GROUP the table by the field Country and has counted
how many times each country name has repeated using the COUNT aggregate function and also the result is ordered in descending order. 

SELECT year, COUNT(*) AS Count FROM Sales GROUP BY year; -- this counts the number of entries for each year

SELECT year, month, COUNT(*) AS Count FROM Sales GROUP BY year, month; -- this counts the number of entries for each month of each year.


- JOIN
JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related field between them. JOIN and INNER JOIN clauses are the same.
INNER JOIN returns records that have a matching value in both tables.

SELECT ProductID, ProductName, CategoryName FROM Products INNER JOIN Categories ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID; -- this query joins the Category table with the Product table. This helps us to know the category of each product. The INNER JOIN keyword returns only rows with a match in both tables. Which means that if we have a product with no CategoryID, or with a CategoryID that is not present in the Categories table, that record would not be returned in the result.

-OUTER JOIN
There are three types of OUTER JOIN. They are LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN and FULL JOIN.

-LEFT JOIN
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table (table2). The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match.

SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID FROM Customers LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName; --as we already know that in LEFT JOIN, all the records from left table will be extracted, the customer name will appear whether or not that customer has any orders or not.

-RIGHT JOIN
The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matching records from the left table (table1). The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match.

-FULL JOIN
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.


-HAVING CLAUSE
HAVING CLAUSE is added to SQL because the WHERE clause cannot be used with aggregate functions.

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country HAVING COUNT (CustomerID)>5; --list the number of customers of each country having more than 5.

SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM Orders INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID GROUP BY LastName HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID)>10; --list the employees that have registered more than 10 orders.
